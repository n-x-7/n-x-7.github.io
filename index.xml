      <description>Hello, everyone! This is my review of the Certified Ethical Hacker (C|EH) Practical exam, which I passed with a perfect score of 20/20 and only took around 1h30min of the 6 hours to complete.
NOTE: I won&amp;rsquo;t be mentioning the exact questions I got for the exam because of NDA but I assure you everything you need to pass the exam is here.
So let me tell you a short story about how I ended up getting a voucher for this exam.</description>

      <description> Hello, The reason I created this blog is to document my learning journey and experience in the field of information security. Youâ€™ll find content here about: writeups/walkthroughs about boxes I do for TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and Vulnhub, and other interesting things that I may write about. I may not be the best writer, but I hope the information you find here may be of any help to you. JS|NX7 </description>
